# 🧾 SnackTrack – C++ Online Food Ordering System

SnackTrack is a simple terminal-based food ordering system built in C++ for our CSC404 Programming 2 project at UiTM. It allows users to register, place orders from a predefined menu, provide feedback, and generate basic reports — all using structured programming, file handling, and C++ standard features.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Practice **structured programming** using `struct`, `functions`, and arrays
- Implement **file I/O** to store and retrieve data (`customer.txt`, `order.txt`, `feedback.txt`)
- Provide a simple **menu-driven interface** for users
- Collaborate as a group using **GitHub**, **CLion**, **Visual Studio Code** and proper project management practices

---

## 📦 Features

- 👤 Register Customer (save to `customer.txt`)
- 🍽️ Place Order (select from menu, calculate total, save to `order.txt`)
- 📋 View Order Summary
- 💬 Insert Feedback (save to `feedback.txt`)
- 🗂️ View All Feedback
- 📊 Generate Report (coming soon)

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- C++20 (CLion IDE)
- File Handling with `fstream`
- Modular code with `.cpp` / `.h` files
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Structured programming using `struct`, 1D & 2D arrays
